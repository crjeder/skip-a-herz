# skip-a-herz
This is a submission for the [Hackaday 1Hz Challenge](https://hackaday.io/contest/203248ference) that explores the just noticeable difference (JND) in human perception of time gaps between tones. It plays tone pairs with varying delays and records user responses to estimate perceptual thresholds in real time.

## 🧠 Concept

This project investigates how small a difference in timing between two tones must be for a person to notice it. Participants listen to tone pairs with slightly varying intervals and respond when they perceive a change. The system estimates the perceptual threshold in real time.

## 🔧 Hardware

- Raspberry Pi Pico
- Active piezo buzzer
- Button (for user input)
- 3D printed case
- Optional: OLED display or serial monitor

## 🛠️ Software

- Firmware: Rust

## 📊 Future Features
- Data logging over USB serial
- Web-based interface for results
